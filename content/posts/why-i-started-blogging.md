## A little about me 
Hi, there a random user, welcome to my first ever blog. Thou i am not sure whom i am greeting to cauz i don't think anyone would ever read it. Haha...laughing at my own jokes, my old act.ShowShareButtons: true

Lemme introduce me to yeah all, especially those Google's web crawlers. I am **Samay Kumar**, known to no one by username **[samay15jan](https://github.com/samay15jan)**.  

Am a Software Developer by profession *(i consider myself in my good books)*, but in reality am a just keen learner who just tries to explore technologies...*yeah u can call me a tech enthusiast*. 

## My journey to blogging
If i really be honest, i don't exactly consider it as a blog. I'm just here to express myself to the world without having any barriers. It's a place where my voice is the only thing u could hear...*voice ? hear ? Seriously, whats wrong with me*.  

I gained my inspiration for blogging from a random user on internet named **[Peter Boone](https://boonepeter.github.io)**.  
So on a fine day, after a long break in my coding journey, i wanted to try something fun. Eventually, i questioned myself "How exactly does Spotify scan codes actually works ?" more about in **[this](https://samay15jan.github.io/posts/exploring-spotify-scan-codes/)** blog.


And from there i stumbled on one of his article, suddenly an idea ignited. An idea to start to start something similar just so that i can have my very own corner on internet.  
So, here i am using hugo with papermodx theme and writing my very own blog about "Why i started blogging".

## What can u expect ?
Let's quickly address the key points of what can u expect with these blogs, cauz it helps in...***coughs***...SEO Ranking. ***Ehh ?*** Sorry, User Experience:-  

- Gain ultimate knowledge from your top notch blogger.
- Learn about tech tutorials, cool tricks and alot more 
- A place where ~~i can waste my time~~ u can get a better understanding of complex stuff in simplest and fun manner.
- Learn how **not** to get inspired by your top notch blogger, so u get an idea what not to do.
- Exclusive insights about latest and older tech from your very own top notch blogger.

> Note: Enough bragging, simply these blogs shouldn't be a thing u should entirely trust on, do your research, let that brain of yours do some work. 

## Conclusion
After all of those heart touching words from your neighborhood blogger, u should conclude that, u guys are going to get some good knowledge, tutorials, insights of technologies and learn from the mistake i made *(which i am not going to share hehe)*.

But still keep your eyes open for the mind boggling beginning of our new journey, where i am as blank like u are after reading this blog, cauz we both don't know what is gonna happen next.

See yeah on the other side.

> PS: Never trust a 19 years old top notch blogger who just started out.
